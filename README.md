## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- Vite

### What I learned

This my first project where I used Vite instead of CRA and I really enjoyed its speed.

### Useful resources

- [Learn React 18 with Redux Toolkit â€“ Full Tutorial for Beginners](https://youtu.be/2-crBg6wpp0) - This helped me start working with react and honestly I like the way the instructor of this course, John Smilga, explains the basic concepts of React, making it possible for begginers to start building their projects using it.
